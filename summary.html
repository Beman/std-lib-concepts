Discussion Summary: Applying Concepts to the Standard Library</h1>

<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:20%;">A joint LWG/LEWG session in Albuquerque discussed 
<a href="https://wg21.link/p0802">P0802R0</a>, <i>Applying 
Concepts to the Standard Library.</i> This document summarizes those discussions and 
any resulting action items. Committee members can see the Albuquerque wiki for full discussion 
notes. </p>
<p><b>Discussion:</b> The two &quot;Big Picture&quot; tenets from P0802R0 were 
presented:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The basis for introducing concepts to the standard library must be the 
  <a href="https://wg21.link/ranges">Ranges 
TS</a>. </li>
  <li>The Ranges TS has two separable components: a library of fundamental concepts 
(TS Clauses 6 &amp; 7), and revisions of existing library components (TS Clauses 
8-12, also known as STL2). <b>The characteristics of these two components are quite 
different, so they should be considered and adopted separately</b>. </li>
</ul>
<p>These drew no further discussion; presumably  they were universally accepted.</p>
<p><b>Discussion:</b> There was strong support for developing written design policies 
and guidelines for the standard library, both in general and specific to 
concepts. </p>
<p><b>Action Item:</b> Jeffrey Yasskin will post a reflector message with further 
information. </p>
<p><b>Action Item:</b> Nathan Myers will start collecting a checklist of interface dos 
and don'ts. (Presumably Nathan's work will build on the existing guidelines 
Jeffrey's posting will reference.) </p>
<p><b>Discussion:</b> There was general agreement that the first step for introducing 
concepts into the standard library is to update C++ WP clause 20, Library 
Introduction, to ready the standard library for the actual addition of concepts.
</p>
<p><b>Action Item:</b> Jonathan Wakely will lead the effort to write a proposal. The 
primary basis will be clause 7 of the Ranges TS, but other TS material may be 
included and other proposals will also be considered, such as: </p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://wg21.link/p0411">P0411</a> Separating Library Requirements and Preconditions by Jonathan Wakely. 
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://wg21.link/p0788">P0788</a> Standard Library Specification in a Concepts and Contracts World by 
Walter E. Brown. </li>
  <li><a href="https://wg21.link/p0830">P0830</a> Using Concepts and requires in the C++ Standard Library by Nicolai 
Josuttis. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Discussion:</b> There was general agreement that the second step for introducing 
concepts to the standard library is to add Ranges TS clause 7, Fundamental 
library concepts, to the C++ WP as soon as Library introduction has been updated 
for concepts and a Fundamental library concepts proposal can be processed. There 
is concern over what namespace Fundamental library concepts should go in. </p>
<p><b>Action Item:</b> Casey Carter and Eric Niebler will lead this effort. They are 
given authority to include other fundamental material from the ranges TS. </p>
<p><b>Discussion:</b> There was considerable discussion of the software engineering 
challenges posed by possible IS adoption of the STL2 portion of the Ranges TS. In 
no particular order, STL2 challenges include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Eric Niebler: Ranges TS work took as given that one could not add constraints 
to algorithms without causing source-level breakages to user-code. Clean sheet 
is needed with new namespace. If we want to make all these changes in namespace 
`std` then it is not reasonable. </li>
  <li>Namespace management, including relationship and interaction between std and 
std2. Much study and papers needed. </li>
  <li>Standard library churn relating to concepts and STL2 causing excessive ABI 
breaks. </li>
  <li>We need to know what concept changes cause ABI breaks. </li>
  <li>Lack of confidence that STL2 will happen. </li>
  <li>Many questions as to what type traits become concepts, what type traits 
survive. Study and papers needed. </li>
  <li>Need transition path for variadic template type traits to concepts. </li>
  <li>Lack of knowledge of how much existing user code would be broken by STL2. 
  </li>
  <li>STL2 challenges are so great no one is willing to commit to lead the STL2 
effort. </li>
  <li>Conceptification is likely to be costly for early adopters. </li>
  <li>Concepts related standard library design, tests, and other concepts work 
can't begin until major compilers are C++20 concepts conformant. Particularly 
for implementors, being Concepts TS conformant is not good enough. </li>
  <li>Titus Winters: ... inventing version 2 is hard as it slows migration. Overlap 
regions are very problematic. Migration with `std` and `std2` in place is very 
hard. What stability are we promising? `stl2` is best if we promise eternal 
stability but this will lead to 2-4x maintenance cost. How many release cycles 
does it cost to move from now to C++next? What are our goals and priorities? 
  </li>
  <li>Jonathan Wakely: If we don't have a clean sheet to add things in parallel, 
even a phased migration path will be problematic as people refuse to abandon 
features. </li>
  <li>We don't have tooling to make migration easy, yet. </li>
  <li>Phased, forced migration may lead to people abandoning C++. Stability vs 
velocity a major concern. </li>
  <li>Various other concerns about migration. </li>
  <li>Beman Dawes: We are not ready to plan migration to STL2. We should set that 
aside and deal with what we do have consensus on. Nico Josuttis: Forget STL2 
when we talk about concepts. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Note:</b> The discussion was about the standard library software 
engineering challenges posed by STL2. The benefits of STL2 are well understood 
by the participants, who included the primary developers of STL2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Discussion:</b> One of the impediments to using concepts to the standard library 
is that LEWG/LWG members have very limited knowledge of designing interfaces 
using concepts, and a show of hands found no one in the room had ever used 
concepts in production code. </p>
<p><b>Action Item:</b> Nico will take the lead in activities to increase LEWG/LWG 
knowledge of concepts. </p>
<p><b>Discussion:</b> We want user feedback on the Ranges TS (and perhaps the Concepts 
TS). Rather than just hope feedback surfaces, we need to proactively seek 
feedback from users. </p>
<p><b>Action Item:</b> Rob Douglas will take the lead in obtaining user feedback, with 
help from Jeffrey Yasskin, Bryce Adelstein-Lelbach and perhaps Hal Finkel. </p>
<p><b>Poll:</b> We should delay IS targeting papers that are using requires clauses 
and/or defining new `concept`s, as per p0802r0 Policy #1 “Build the Concepts 
Foundations First?” </p>
<p><b>SF&nbsp; F&nbsp; N&nbsp; A&nbsp; SA <br>
</b>&nbsp; 4 21 10&nbsp; 2&nbsp; 0 </p>
<p><b>Poll:</b> We should start using requires clauses instead of “shall not 
participate in overload resolution” NOW, before the suggestions of Policy #1?
</p>
<p><b>SF&nbsp; F&nbsp;&nbsp; N&nbsp; A&nbsp; SA <br>
&nbsp; </b>0&nbsp; 2&nbsp; 10 19&nbsp; 4 </p>
<p><b>Action Item:</b> Titus Winters: Papers pointing out what we need to do are useful. 
More please! </p>
